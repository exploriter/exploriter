		<p>I do my best work when I have the freedom to explore complex ideas, clarify complicated systems, and get my hands dirty under the sun. Preferably, in conscious (in-person) collaboration with others&mdash;who are committed to <em>the good</em>, <em>the true</em>, and <em>the beautiful</em>&mdash;toward meaningful works.</p>
		<h2 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Where I've been</h2>
		<p>Over the years, I have explored many domains as a software designer, web developer, project manager, product strategist, information architect, writer, fitness trainer, line cook, theatre projectionist, rare coin and diamond merchant, amateur horticulturist, glassblower, and postal worker.</p>
		<ul class="list-disc ml-6">
			<li class="mb-2"><b>In 2009</b>, I created a recipe blog to learn SEO. Its success landed me a multi-book deal that has since produced a national bestseller, seven translations, and sold over 300,000 copies.</li>
			<li class="mb-2"><b>From 2010 to 2015</b>, I designed and developed over 100 websites for small to medium-sized businesses under the brand, Designpx.</li>
			<li class="mb-2"><b>From 2014 to 2020</b>, I was part of the core leadership team (CTO) at GMB Fitness. Leading product development, implementing project management, and improving team cohesion systems and practices across the company.</li>
			<li class="mb-2"><b>From 2020 to 2022</b>, I took a work hiatus to pursue unencumbered thinking, reading, and other philosophical, spiritual, and embodied practices.</li>
			<li><b>In 2023</b>, I joined the <a href="https://vervaekefoundation.org/" target="_blank">The Vervaeke Foundation</a> to help launch their series of websites.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Where I am now</h2>
		<p><b>Beginning in 2024</b>, I began building <strong>Exploriter</strong> in earnest. A symbolic portmanteau for a creative endeavor comprised of ideas, interests, and collaborations. Some of which have long lingered in my mind and heart and since they refuse to leave, I must pursue them.</p>
		<ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
			<li class="mb-2"><strong>exp/daily</strong> &mdash; A learning companion and library, centered around minimum daily practice, and organized by mutually affording principles and taxonomies.</li>
			<li class="mb-2"><strong>Exploriter Studio</strong> &mdash; a highly selective web design and development studio and successor to Designpx. Focussed on clarity, for discerning clientele, and an homage to simple HTML, CSS, and JS.</li>
			<li class="mb-2"><strong>Walking Games</strong> &mdash; a walking (ad)venture.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>I am currently invested in (and investigating) various projects, DAOs, NFTs, and tokens in the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems.</p>
		<p>Outside the business realm, I have recently taken up the art and craft of drawing and am exploring relief wood carving.</p>
		<p>I maintain a diverse physical fitness practice that includes kettlebell training, rope flow, stability ball, elements of qigong, bodyweight floor movements, breathwork, and all the fresh air and sunshine I can get.</p>
